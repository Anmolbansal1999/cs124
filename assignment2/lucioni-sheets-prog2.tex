\section*{Analytical Approach}

\hspace{4mm} The conventional algorithm requires $n^3$ multiplications and $n^2(n-1)$ additions. Thus, the work required by the conventional algorithm, used when $n \leq n_0$, is $n^3 + n^2(n-1) = 2n^3 - n^2$. Strassens's algorithm requires 7 matrix products per recurrence, 10 additions and subtractions when deriving the $P_1, \ldots, P_7$, and 8 additions and subtractions when manipulating the $P_i$'s to find the matrix sums. The work required by Strassen's algorithm, used when $n > n_0$, can be represented by the recurrence $T(n) = 7T(\frac{n}{2}) + (10+8)\frac{n^2}{4} = 7T(\frac{n}{2}) + \frac{9}{2}n^2$, where $T(1) = 1$. Using Mathematica, we find that the solution to this recurrence with the given initial condition is $T(n) = 7^{(\log_2 n) + 1}-6 n^2$. This gives us the following function, which we wish to minimize over all $n$:
\[
    f(n)= 
\begin{cases}
    7^{(\log_2 n) + 1}-6 n^2, & \text{if } n > n_0 \\
    2n^3 - n^2, & \text{if } n \leq n_0\\
\end{cases}
\]

We can analytically determine the value of $n_0$ that optimizes the running time of the variant of Strassen's we are studying by setting equal both cases contained in $f$ and solving for $n$. Using Mathematica to solve the equation $7^{(\log_2 n) + 1}-6 n^2 = 2n^3 - n^2$, we see that both sides are equal when $n = 1$ and $n \approx 654.031$. The former value of $n$ is uninteresting, since we already know that the base case of Strassen's algorithm (i.e., when $n=1$) functions the same as the conventional method. Thus, we have analytically determined that $n_0 \approx 654.031$.
