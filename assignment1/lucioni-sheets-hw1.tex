\section{Quantitative Results}
\subsection*{Dimension 0 - Weights Assigned Randomly}

The following is a graph showing the average tree size over 10 trials for several values of $n$: \\ \\
A simple function that describes this plot is $f(n) = $

\subsection*{Dimension 2 - Unit Square}

The following is a graph showing the average tree size over 10 trials for several values of $n$: \\ \\
A simple function that describes this plot is $f(n) = $

\subsection*{Dimension 3 - Unit Cube}

The following is a graph showing the average tree size over 10 trials for several values of $n$: \\ \\
A simple function that describes this plot is $f(n) = $

\subsection*{Dimension 4 - Hypercube}

The following is a graph showing the average tree size over 10 trials for several values of $n$: \\ \\
A simple function that describes this plot is $f(n) = $

\section*{Discussion}

explain choice of Kruskal's, and any approach to helping the program handle large $n$ \\ \\
Are the growth rates (the f(n)) surprising? Can you come up with an explanation for them? \\ \\
How long does it take your algorithm to run? Does this make sense? Do you notice things like the cache size of your computer having an effect? \\ \\
Did you have any interesting experiences with the random number generator? Do you trust it? \\ \\
